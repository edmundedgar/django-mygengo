# django myGengo plugin

This Django plugin integrates with the [myGengo API](http://www.mygengo.com/services/api/) to offer low-cost, high-quality translation.

## Setup

- Make sure Django is installed, and run 'python manage.py syncdb' and 'python manage.py runserver' from this directory. 

- To get started, register a username and password and configure your myGengo API keys on the settings page. 

- Make sure to change the DEBUG value in settings.py to False before deploying to production. When DEBUG is False, use live API keys.

- View the [myGengo API](http://www.mygengo.com/services/api/) documentation for more details
